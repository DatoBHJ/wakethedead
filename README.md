- Various API keys (see Configuration section)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wakethedead.git
cd wakethedead
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:
```env
# Required API Keys
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key                    # Required: Main LLM API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key                # Required: For chunk embeddings
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL_1=your_upstash_url        # Required: For article caching
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN_1=your_upstash_token    # Required: For article caching
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL_2=your_upstash_url_2      # Required: For chunk embeddings
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN_2=your_upstash_token_2  # Required: For chunk embeddings

# Optional API Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000        # Optional: Default is localhost:3000
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1         # Optional: For local embeddings
SERPER_API=your_serper_api_key                    # Optional: Alternative search API
SEARCH_API_KEY=your_search_api_key                # Optional: Alternative search API
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key                      # Optional: For xAI model access
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration

Rate limiting can be disabled by setting `useRateLimiting` to `false` in `app/config.tsx`:

```typescript
// app/config.tsx
export const config = {
  useRateLimiting: false,  // Set to false to disable rate limiting
  // ... other configurations
}

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
